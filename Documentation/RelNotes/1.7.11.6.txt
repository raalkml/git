Git v1.7.11.6 Release Notes
===========================

Fixes since v1.7.11.5
---------------------

This is primarily documentation and low-impact code clarification.

 - "ciabot" script (in contrib/) has been updated with extensive
   documentation.

 - The "--rebase" option to "git pull" can be abbreviated to "-r",
   but we didn't document it.

 - It was generally understood that "--long-option"s to many of our
   subcommands can be abbreviated to the unique prefix, but it was not
   easy to find it described for new readers of the documentation set.

 - The "--topo-order", "--date-order" (and the lack of either means
   the default order) options to "rev-list" and "log" family of
   commands were poorly described in the documentation.

 - Older parts of the documentation described as if having a regular
   file in .git/refs/ hierarchy were the only way to have branches and
   tags, which is not true for quite some time.

 - A utility shell function test_seq has been added as a replacement
   for the 'seq' utility found on some platforms.

 - Fallback 'getpass' implementation made unportable use of stdio API.

 - "git commit --amend" let the user edit the log message and then
   died when the human-readable committer name was given
   insufficiently by getpwent(3).
