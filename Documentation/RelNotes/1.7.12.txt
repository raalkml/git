Git v1.7.12 Release Notes
=========================

Updates since v1.7.11
---------------------

UI, Workflows & Features

 * Per-user $HOME/.gitconfig file can optionally be stored in
   $HOME/.config/git/config instead, which is in line with XDG.

 * The value of core.attributesfile and core.excludesfile default to
   $HOME/.config/attributes and $HOME/.config/ignore respectively when
   these files exist.

 * Scripted Porcelain writers now have access to the credential API via
   the "git credential" plumbing command.

 * "git help" used to always default to "man" format even on platforms
   where "man" viewer is not widely available.

 * "git clone --local $path" started its life as an experiment to
   optionally use link/copy when cloning a repository on the disk, but
   we didn't deprecate it after we made the option a no-op to always
   use the optimization.  The command learned "--no-local" option to
   turn this off, as a more explicit alternative over use of file://
   URL.

 * "git fetch" and friends used to say "remote side hung up
   unexpectedly" when they failed to get response they expect from the
   other side, but one common reason why they don't get expected
   response is that the remote repository does not exist or cannot be
   read. The error message in this case was updated to give better
   hints to the user.

 * git native protocol agents learned to show software version over
   the wire, so that the server log can be examined to see the vintage
   distribution of clients.

 * "git help -w $cmd" can show HTML version of documentation for
   "git-$cmd" by setting help.htmlpath to somewhere other than the
   default location where the build procedure installs them locally;
   the variable can even point at a http:// URL.

 * "git rebase -i" learned "-x <cmd>" to insert "exec <cmd>" after
   each commit in the resulting history.

 * "git status" gives finer classification to various states of paths
   in conflicted state and offer advice messages in its output.

 * "git submodule" learned to deal with nested submodule structure
   where a module is contained within a module whose origin is
   specified as a relative URL to its superproject's origin.

 * A rather heavy-ish "git completion" script has been split to create
   a separate "git prompting" script, to help lazy-autoloading of the
   completion part while making prompting part always available.


Foreign Interface


Performance, Internal Implementation, etc. (please report possible regressions)

 * Some tests showed false failures caused by a bug in ecryptofs.

 * We no longer use AsciiDoc7 syntax in our documentation and favor a
   more modern style.

 * "git index-pack" and "git pack-objects" use streaming API to read
   from the object store to avoid having to hold a large blob object
   in-core while they are doing their thing.

 * Code to match paths with exclude patterns learned to avoid calling
   fnmatch() by comparing fixed leading substring literally when
   possible.


Also contains minor documentation updates and code clean-ups.


Fixes since v1.7.11
-------------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes since v1.7.11 in the maintenance
releases are contained in this release (see release notes to them for
details).

 * We did not have test to make sure "git rebase" without extra options
   filters out an empty commit in the original history.
   (merge 2b5ba7b mz/empty-rebase-test later to maint).

 * "git fast-export" produced an input stream for fast-import without
   properly quoting pathnames when they contain SPs in them.
   (merge ff59f6d js/fast-export-paths-with-spaces later to maint).

 * "git checkout --detach", when you are still on an unborn branch,
   should be forbidden, but it wasn't.
   (merge 8ced1aa cw/no-detaching-an-unborn later to maint).

 * Some implementations of Perl terminates "lines" with CRLF even when
   the script is operating on just a sequence of bytes.  Make sure to
   use "$PERL_PATH", the version of Perl the user told Git to use, in
   our tests to avoid unnecessary breakages in tests.
   (merge ad78585 vr/use-our-perl-in-tests later to maint).
