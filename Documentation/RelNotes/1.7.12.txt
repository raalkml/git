Git v1.7.12 Release Notes
=========================

Updates since v1.7.11
---------------------

UI, Workflows & Features

 * "git help" used to always default to "man" format even on platforms
   where "man" viewer is not widely available.

 * "git clone --local $path" started its life as an experiment to
   optionally use link/copy when cloning a repository on the disk, but
   we didn't deprecate it after we made the option a no-op to always
   use the optimization.  The command learned "--no-local" option to
   turn this off, as a more explicit alternative over use of file://
   URL.

 * git native protocol agents learned to show software version over
   the wire, so that the server log can be examined to see the vintage
   distribution of clients.


Foreign Interface


Performance, Internal Implementation, etc. (please report possible regressions)

 * Some tests showed false failures caused by a bug in ecryptofs.

 * We no longer use AsciiDoc7 syntax in our documentation and favor a
   more modern style.


Also contains minor documentation updates and code clean-ups.


Fixes since v1.7.11
-------------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes since v1.7.11 in the maintenance
releases are contained in this release (see release notes to them for
details).

 * The documentation for "git cherry-pick A B..C" was misleading.
   (merge b98878e cn/cherry-pick-range-docs later to maint).

 * "git archive" incorrectly computed the header checksum; the symptom
   was observed only when using pathnames with hi-bit set.
   (merge a5a46eb jc/ustar-checksum-is-unsigned later to maint).

 * Running "git bundle verify" on a bundle that records a complete
   history said "it requires these 0 commits".
   (merge 8c3710f jc/bundle-complete-notice later to maint).

 * "git ls-files --exclude=t -i" did not consider anything under t/ as
   excluded, as it did not pay attention to exclusion of leading paths
   while walking the index.  Other two users of excluded() are also
   updated.
   (merge 0d316f0 jc/ls-files-i-dir later to maint).

 * "git request-pull $url dev" when the tip of "dev" branch was tagged
   with "ext4-for-linus" used the contents from the tag in the output
   but still asked the "dev" branch to be pulled, not the tag.
   (merge 682853e jc/request-pull-match-tagname later to maint).
