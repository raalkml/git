Git v1.7.12 Release Notes
=========================

Updates since v1.7.11
---------------------

UI, Workflows & Features

 * "git help" used to always default to "man" format even on platforms
   where "man" viewer is not widely available.

 * "git clone --local $path" started its life as an experiment to
   optionally use link/copy when cloning a repository on the disk, but
   we didn't deprecate it after we made the option a no-op to always
   use the optimization.  The command learned "--no-local" option to
   turn this off, as a more explicit alternative over use of file://
   URL.

 * git native protocol agents learned to show software version over
   the wire, so that the server log can be examined to see the vintage
   distribution of clients.

 * "git rebase -i" learned "-x <cmd>" to insert "exec <cmd>" after
   each commit in the resulting history.

 * "git status" gives finer classification to various states of paths
   in conflicted state and offer advice messages in its output.

 * "git submodule" learned to deal with nested submodule structure
   where a module is contained within a module whose origin is
   specified as a relative URL to its superproject's origin.

 * A rather heavy-ish "git completion" script has been split to create
   a separate "git prompting" script, to help lazy-autoloading of the
   completion part while making prompting part always available.


Foreign Interface


Performance, Internal Implementation, etc. (please report possible regressions)

 * Some tests showed false failures caused by a bug in ecryptofs.

 * We no longer use AsciiDoc7 syntax in our documentation and favor a
   more modern style.

 * "git index-pack" and "git pack-objects" use streaming API to read
   from the object store to avoid having to hold a large blob object
   in-core while they are doing their thing.

 * Code to match paths with exclude patterns learned to avoid calling
   fnmatch() by comparing fixed leading substring literally when
   possible.


Also contains minor documentation updates and code clean-ups.


Fixes since v1.7.11
-------------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes since v1.7.11 in the maintenance
releases are contained in this release (see release notes to them for
details).

 * When "git log" gets "--simplify-merges/by-decoration" together with
   "--first-parent", the combination of these options makes the
   simplification logic to use in-core commit objects that haven't
   been examined for relevance, either producing incorrect result or
   taking too long to produce any output.  Teach the simplification
   logic to ignore commits that the first-parent traversal logic
   ignored when both are in effect to work around the issue.
   (merge 6e513ba jc/rev-list-simplify-merges-first-parent later to maint).

 * "git add" allows adding a regular file to the path where a
   submodule used to exist, but "git update-index" does not allow an
   equivalent operation to Porcelain writers.
   (merge 242f55f hv/submodule-update-nuke-submodules later to maint).

 * "git diff --no-index" did not work with pagers correctly.
   (merge af63b54 jk/diff-no-index-pager later to maint).

 * "git diff COPYING HEAD:COPYING" gave a nonsense error message that
   claimed that the treeish HEAD did not have COPYING in it.
   (merge 023e37c mm/verify-filename-fix later to maint).

 * The documentation for "git cherry-pick A B..C" was misleading.
   (merge b98878e cn/cherry-pick-range-docs later to maint).

 * "git archive" incorrectly computed the header checksum; the symptom
   was observed only when using pathnames with hi-bit set.
   (merge a5a46eb jc/ustar-checksum-is-unsigned later to maint).

 * Running "git bundle verify" on a bundle that records a complete
   history said "it requires these 0 commits".
   (merge 8c3710f jc/bundle-complete-notice later to maint).

 * "git ls-files --exclude=t -i" did not consider anything under t/ as
   excluded, as it did not pay attention to exclusion of leading paths
   while walking the index.  Other two users of excluded() are also
   updated.
   (merge 0d316f0 jc/ls-files-i-dir later to maint).

 * "git request-pull $url dev" when the tip of "dev" branch was tagged
   with "ext4-for-linus" used the contents from the tag in the output
   but still asked the "dev" branch to be pulled, not the tag.
   (merge 682853e jc/request-pull-match-tagname later to maint).
