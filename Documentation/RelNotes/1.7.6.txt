Git v1.7.5 Release Notes (draft)
========================

Updates since v1.7.5
--------------------

 * Various git-svn updates.

 * When an object "$tree:$path" does not exist, if $path does exist in the
   subtree of $tree that corresponds to the subdirectory the user is in,
   git now suggests using "$tree:./$path" in addition to the advice to use
   the full path from the root of the working tree.

 * "git blame" learned "--abbrev[=<n>]" option to control the minimum
   number of hexdigits shown for commit object names.

 * "git clean" used to fail on an empty directory that is not readable,
   even though rmdir(2) could remove such a directory.  Now we attempt it
   as the last resort.

 * "git format-patch" learned "--quiet" option to suppress the output of
   the names of generated files.

 * "git merge" learned "-" as a short-hand for "the previous branch", just
   like the way "git checkout -" works.

 * "git pack-object" now takes core.bigfilethreashold into account, just
   like fast-imoprt does.

 * "git reflog" allows options like "--format=.." to be given.

 * "git stash apply" can now apply to a working tree with changes as long
   as there is no overlapping change as the stash being applied.

 * "git stash apply @{99999}" now is diagnosed as an error, unless you
   really have that many stash entries.

Also contains various documentation updates.


Fixes since v1.7.5
------------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes in 1.7.5.X maintenance track are
included in this release.

 * The "--date=relative" output format used to say "X years, 12 months"
   when it should have said "X+1 years".
   (merge mg/x-years-12-months later)

 * "git config" used to choke with an insanely long line.
   (merge ef/maint-strbuf-init later)

 * The "--dirstat" option of "diff" family of commands used to totally
   ignore a change that only rearranged lines within a file.  Such a
   change now counts as at least a minimum but non zero change.

 * The "--dirstat" option of "diff" family of commands used to use the
   pathname in the original, instead of the pathname in the result,
   when renames are involved.
   (merge jh/dirstat for the above two later)

 * "git format-patch" when run with "--quiet" option used to produce a
   nonsense result that consists of alternating empty output.
   (merge early part of cn/format-patch-quiet later)

 * "git stash -p --no-keep-index" and "git stash --no-keep-index -p" now
   mean the same thing.
   (merge dm/stash-k-i-p later)

 * "git upload-pack" (hence "git push" over git native protocol) had a
   subtle race condition that could lead to a deadlock.
   (merge jk/maint-upload-pack-shallow later)
