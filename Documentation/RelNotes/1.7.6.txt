Git v1.7.6 Release Notes (draft)
========================

Updates since v1.7.5
--------------------

 * Various git-svn updates.

 * Clean-up of the C part of i18n (but not l10n---please wait)
   continues.

 * Processes spawned by "[alias] <name> = !process" in the configuration
   can inspect GIT_PREFIX environment variable to learn where in the
   working tree the original command was invoked.

 * "git blame" learned "--abbrev[=<n>]" option to control the minimum
   number of hexdigits shown for commit object names.

 * "git cvsimport" learned that CVSNT stores its password file in a
   location different from the traditional CVS.

 * "git diff -C -C" used to disable the rename detection entirely when
   there are too many copy candidate paths in the tree; now it falls
   back to "-C" when doing so would keep the copy candidate paths
   under the rename detection limit.

 * "git format-patch" learned "--quiet" option to suppress the output of
   the names of generated files.

 * "git format-patch" quotes people's names when it has RFC822 special
   characters in it, e.g. "Junio C. Hamano" <jch@example.com>.  Earlier
   it was up to the user to do this when using its output.

 * "git log" and friends learned a new "--notes" option to replace the
   "--show-notes" option.  Unlike "--show-notes", "--notes=<ref>" does
   not imply showing the default notes.

 * "git merge" learned "-" as a short-hand for "the previous branch", just
   like the way "git checkout -" works.

 * "git merge-one-file" learned to honor GIT_WORK_TREE settings when
   handling "both sides added, differently" conflict.

 * "git rev-list --count" used with "--cherry-mark" counts the cherry-picked
   commits separately, producing more a useful output.

 * "git submodule update" learned "--force" option to get rid of local
   changes in submodules and replace them with the up-to-date version.

 * Compressed tarball gitweb generates is made without the timestamp of
   the tarball generation; snapshot from the same tree should result in
   a same tarball.

 * "git-p4" (in contrib) learned to merge a file that was added on both
   branches differently by using 2-way merge.

Also contains various documentation updates and minor miscellaneous
changes.


Fixes since v1.7.5
------------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes in 1.7.5.X maintenance track are
included in this release.

 * "git config" used to choke with an insanely long line.
   (merge ef/maint-strbuf-init later)

 * "git diff-files" did not show the mode information from the working
   tree side of an unmerged path correctly.
   (merge jc/fix-diff-files-unmerged later)

 * "git diff -M --cached" used to use unmerged path as a possible rename
   source candidate, which made no sense.
   (merge mz/maint-rename-unmerged later)

 * "git format-patch" when run with "--quiet" option used to produce a
   nonsense result that consists of alternating empty output.
   (merge early part of cn/format-patch-quiet later)

 * "git format-patch" did not quote RFC822 special characters in the
   email address (e.g From: Junio C. Hamano <jch@example.com>, not
   From: "Junio C. Hamano" <jch@example.com>).
   (merge jk/format-patch-quote-special-in-from later)

 * "git mergetool" did not handle conflicted submoudules gracefully.
   (merge jm/mergetool-submodules later)

 * "git rebase -i -p" failed to preserve the history when there is a
   redundant merge created with the --no-ff option.
   (merge aw/maint-rebase-i-p-no-ff later)

 * "git stash -p --no-keep-index" and "git stash --no-keep-index -p" now
   mean the same thing.
   (merge dm/stash-k-i-p later)

 * "git upload-pack" (hence "git push" over git native protocol) had a
   subtle race condition that could lead to a deadlock.
   (merge jk/maint-upload-pack-shallow later)
