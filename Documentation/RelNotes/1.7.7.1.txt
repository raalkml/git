Git v1.7.7.1 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.7.7
------------------

 * "git diff $tree $path" used to apply the pathspec at the output stage,
   reading the whole tree, wasting resources.

 * The code to check for updated submodules during a "git fetch" of the
   superproject had an unnecessary quadratic loop.

 * "git fetch" from a large bundle did not enable the progress output.

 * When "git fsck --lost-and-found" found that an empty blob object in the
   object store is unreachable, it incorrectly reported an error after
   writing the lost blob out successfully.

 * "git filter-branch" did not refresh the index before checking that the
   working tree was clean.

 * "git grep $tree" when run with multiple threads had an unsafe access to
   the object database that should have been protected with mutex.

 * The "--ancestry-path" option to "git log" and friends misbehaved in a
   history with complex criss-cross merges and showed an uninteresting
   side history as well.

 * Test t1304 assumed LOGNAME is always set, which may not be true on
   some systems.

 * Tests with --valgrind failed to find "mergetool" scriptlets.

 * "git patch-id" miscomputed the patch-id in a patch that has a line longer
   than 1kB.

 * When an "exec" insn failed after modifying the index and/or the working
   tree during "rebase -i", we now check and warn that the changes need to
   be cleaned up.
