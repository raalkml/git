Git v1.7.8.4 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.7.8.3
--------------------

 * The code to look up attributes for paths reused entries from a wrong
   directory when two paths in question are in adjacent directories and
   the name of the one directory is a prefix of the other.

 * "git send-email" did not properly treat sendemail.multiedit as a
   boolean (e.g. setting it to "false" did not turn it off).

Also contains minor fixes and documentation updates.
