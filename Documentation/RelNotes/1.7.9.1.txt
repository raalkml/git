Git v1.7.9.1 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.7.9
------------------

 * Subprocesses spawned from various git programs were often left running
   to completion even when the top-level process was killed.

 * Using "git grep -l/-L" together with options -W or --break may not
   make much sense as the output is to only count the number of hits
   and there is no place for file breaks, but the latter options made
   "-l/-L" to miscount the hits.

 * "git log --first-parent $pathspec" did not stay on the first parent
   chain and veered into side branch from which the whole change to the
   specified paths came.

 * "git push -q" was not sufficiently quiet.

 * When "git push" fails to update any refs, the client side did not
   report an error correctly to the end user.

 * "git mergetool" now gives an empty file as the common base version
   to the backend when dealing with the "both sides added, differently"
   case.

 * When asking for a tag to be pulled, "request-pull" did not show the
   name of the tag prefixed with "tags/", which would have helped older
   clients.

 * "git submodule add $path" forgot to recompute the name to be stored
   in .gitmodules when the submodule at $path was once added to the
   superproject and already initialized.

Also contains minor fixes and documentation updates.
