Git v1.7.9.1 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.7.9
------------------

 * Subprocesses spawned from various git programs were often left running
   to completion even when the top-level process was killed.

 * "git log --first-parent $pathspec" did not stay on the first parent
   chain and veered into side branch from which the whole change to the
   specified paths came.

 * "git push -q" was not sufficiently quiet.

 * When "git push" fails to update any refs, the client side did not
   report an error correctly to the end user.

Also contains minor fixes and documentation updates.
