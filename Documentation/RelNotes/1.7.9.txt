Git v1.7.9 Release Notes (draft)
========================

Updates since v1.7.8
--------------------

 * Porcelain commands like "git reset" did not distinguish deletions
   and type-changes from ordinary modification, and reported them with
   the same 'M' moniker. They now use 'D' (for deletion) and 'T' (for
   type-change) to match "git status -s" and "git diff --name-status".

 * fsck and prune are relatively lengthy operations that still go
   silent while making the end-user wait. They learned to give progress
   output like other slow operations.

 * The set of built-in function-header patterns for various languages
   knows MATLAB.

 * "git pull" can be used to fetch and merge an annotated/signed tag,
   instead of the tip of a topic branch. The GPG signature from the
   signed tag is recorded in the resulting merge commit for later
   auditing.

 * "git branch --edit-description" can be used to add descriptive text
   to explain what a topic branch is about.

 * "git fmt-merge-msg" learned to take the branch description into
   account when preparing a merge summary that "git merge" records
   when merging a local branch.

 * "git request-pull" has been updated to convey more information
   useful for integrators to decide if a topic is worth merging and
   what is pulled is indeed what the requestor asked to pull,
   including:

   - the tip of the branch being requested to be merged;
   - the branch description describing what the topic is about;
   - the contents of the annotated tag, when requesting to pull a tag.

 * "git pull" learned to notice 'pull.rebase' configuration variable,
   which serves as a global fallback for setting 'branch.<name>.rebase'
   configuration variable per branch.


Also contains minor documentation updates and code clean-ups.


Fixes since v1.7.8
------------------

 * In some codepaths (notably, checkout and merge), the ignore patterns
   recorded in $GIT_DIR/info/exclude were not honored. They now are.
   (merge fc001b5 nd/maint-ignore-exclude later to maint).
