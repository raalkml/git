Git 1.8.1.2 Release Notes
=========================

Fixes since v1.8.1.1
--------------------

 * "git archive" did not record uncompressed size in the header when
   streaming a zip archive, which confused some implementations of unzip.

 * When users spelled "cc:" in lowercase in the fake "header" in the
   trailer part, "git send-email" failed to pick up the addresses from
   there. As e-mail headers field names are case insensitive, this
   script should follow suit and treat "cc:" and "Cc:" the same way.
