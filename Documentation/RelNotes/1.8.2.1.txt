Git v1.8.2.1 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.8.2
------------------

 * "git submodule update", when recursed into sub-submodules, did not
   acccumulate the prefix paths.

 * "git am $maildir/" applied messages in an unexpected order; sort
   filenames read from the maildir/ in a way that is more likely to
   sort messages in the order the writing MUA meant to, by sorting
   numeric segment in numeric order and non-numeric segment in
   alphabetical order.

 * When export-subst is used, "zip" output recorded incorrect
   size of the file.

 * Some platforms and users spell UTF-8 differently; retry with the
   most official "UTF-8" when the system does not understand the
   user-supplied encoding name that are the common alternative
   spellings of UTF-8.

 * "git branch" did not bother to check nonsense command line
   parameters and issue errors in many cases.

 * "git update-index -h" did not do the usual "-h(elp)" thing.

 * perl/Git.pm::cat_blob slurped everything in core only to write it
   out to a file descriptor, which was not a very smart thing to do.

 * The SSL peer verification done by "git imap-send" did not ask for
   Server Name Indication (RFC 4366), failing to connect SSL/TLS
   sites that serve multiple hostnames on a single IP.

 * "git index-pack" had a buffer-overflow while preparing an
   informational message when the translated version of it was too
   long.

 * Clarify in the documentation "what" gets pushed to "where" when the
   command line to "git push" does not say these explicitly.

 * In "git reflog expire", REACHABLE bit was not cleared from the
   correct objects.

 * The "--color=<when>" argument to the commands in the diff family
   was described poorly.

 * The arguments given to pre-rebase hook were not documented.

 * The v4 index format was not documented.

 * The "--match=<pattern>" argument "git describe" takes uses glob
   pattern but it wasn't obvious from the documentation.

 * Some sources failed to compile on systems that lack NI_MAXHOST in
   their system header (e.g. z/OS).

 * Add an example use of "--env-filter" in "filter-branch"
   documentation.

 * "git bundle verify" did not say "records a complete history" for a
   bundle that does not have any prerequisites.

 * In the v1.8.0 era, we changed symbols that do not have to be global
   to file scope static, but a few functions in graph.c were used by
   CGit from sideways bypassing the entry points of the API the
   in-tree users use.

 * "git merge-tree" had a typo in the logic to detect d/f conflicts,
   which caused it to segfault in some cases.
