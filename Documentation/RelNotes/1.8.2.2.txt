Git v1.8.2.2 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.8.2.1
--------------------

 * Perl scripts like "git-svn" closed (not redirecting to /dev/null)
   the standard error stream, which is not a very smart thing to do.
   Later open may return file descriptor #2 for unrelated purpose, and
   error reporting code may write into them.

 * "git apply --whitespace=fix" was not prepared to see a line getting
   longer after fixing whitespaces (e.g. tab-in-indent aka Python).

 * "git diff/log --cc" did not work well with options that ignore
   whitespace changes.

 * Documentation on setting up a http server that requires
   authentication only on the push but not fetch has been clarified.

 * A few bugfixes to "git rerere" working on corner case merge
   conflicts have been applied.

 * "git bundle" did not like a bundle created using a commit without
   any message as its one of the prerequistes.
