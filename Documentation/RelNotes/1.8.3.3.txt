Git v1.8.3.3 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.8.3.2
--------------------

 * Mac OS X does not like to write(2) more than INT_MAX number of
   bytes; work it around by chopping write(2) into smaller pieces.

 * Newer MacOS X encourages the programs to compile and link with
   their CommonCrypto, not with OpenSSL.
