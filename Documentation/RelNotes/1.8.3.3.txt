Git v1.8.3.3 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.8.3.2
--------------------

 * "gitweb" forgot to clear a global variable $search_regexp upon each
   request, mistakenly carrying over the previous search to a new one
   when used as a persistent CGI.

 * The wildmatch engine did not honor WM_CASEFOLD option correctly.

 * "git log -c --follow $path" segfaulted upon hitting the commit that
   renamed the $path being followed.

 * When a reflog notation is used for implicit "current branch",
   e.g. "git log @{u}", we did not say which branch and worse said
   "branch ''" in the error messages.

 * Mac OS X does not like to write(2) more than INT_MAX number of
   bytes; work it around by chopping write(2) into smaller pieces.

 * Newer MacOS X encourages the programs to compile and link with
   their CommonCrypto, not with OpenSSL.

Also contains various minor documentation updates.
