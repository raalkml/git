Git v2.0.2 Release Notes
========================

 * Documentation for "git submodule sync" forgot to say that the subcommand
   can take the "--recursive" option.

 * Mishandling of patterns in .gitignore that has trailing SPs quoted
   with backslashes (e.g. ones that end with "\ ") have been
   corrected.

 * Recent updates to "git repack" started to duplicate objects that
   are in packfiles marked with .keep flag into the new packfile by
   mistake.
